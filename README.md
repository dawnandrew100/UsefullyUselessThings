# UsefullyUselessThings
A site full of usefully useless stuff and things

The first goal of this site is to add information from extensions from each state about best crops to plant. 
Eventually, this site will also be home to everything from real time traffic light data to random data science quests and may one day be merged with walkable world.

# Environmental Health Dashboard

Using either Go or Python, I would like to gather data from trustworthy sources about key environmental factors affecting various states in the US as well as the country of the Bahamas. Initially this will be focused on Maryland, DC, Virginia, and the Bahamas but my hope is for this to cover all 50 states as well as some other international destinations depending on the amount and quality of the data.  

## Long term goals

The long term goals of this project are to determine what factors are most important in determining the health of the environment as well as the best way to subdivide areas (by county, by zone, by state, etc) as well as to distill this information into a concise series of charts in order to at a glance get a general idea of environmental conditions.
Currently, my thoughts are to track keystone species, as well as the habitat of endangered species in addition to the health of the water, soil quality, and air quality, among other factors. My initial thoughts are to use sources such as NOAA and Audubon to track weather and species habitats.
