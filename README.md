# UsefullyUselessThings
A site full of usefully useless stuff and things

The first goal of this site is to add information from extensions from each state about best crops to plant. 
Eventually, this site will also be home to everything from real time traffic light data to random data science quests and may one day be merged with walkable world.

# Walkable-World

This project will take advatage of open source software such as [OSM Python tools](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMPythonTools) in order to build a global transportation network
It is also the goal of this project to take user data for where users want to go in order to build hypothetical future train/bus/metro/bike routes that could cut down on travel time

## Long term goals

A transportation network that can build routes across multiple regions and jurisdictions. Ex. Baltimore, MD to JFK Airport, NYC, NY via train
Allow for users to choose whether to take trains or busses exclusively or take a mix of transportation methods including biking and walking

The intention for this project is not only to be a routing application, but also a location to store itineraries as well as easily access external sites to purchase tickets for a trip across multiple agencies!
