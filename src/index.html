			<h1>Purpose</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this website is twofold. The primary goal is to practice my data illustration skills and build my toolkit as a data scientist, but also to have a collection of graphs, or charts, or anything that may be useful to someone; even if it may not be useful to me.</p>
